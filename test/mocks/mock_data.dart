      shortSummary:
          'QuantumOS is a groundbreaking new operating system that claims to bring the power of quantum computing to everyday devices. Unveiled by a mysterious startup with backing from top Silicon Valley investors, it promises lightning-fast performance by using qubits for parallel processing. With features like real-time language translation, predictive multitasking, and quantum-level encryption, the OS has sparked both excitement and skepticism. Developers are invited to use a custom language called Q# to build applications tailored for this hybrid quantum-classical environment. While some hail it as the future of computing, others question whether the technology is truly viable—or just clever marketing.',
