# Kite
## News app by Kagi

# Why Kite? Because news is broken.

Driven by relentless ad monetization, news has become mental junk food - an endless stream of clickbait that destroys our ability to think deeply and clearly. We can do better, and create what news should have been all along - pure, essential information that respects your intelligence and time.

# Understanding our approach

World doesn't live in echo chambers. The reality emerges from the collision of different viewpoints and perspectives - that's how we separate signal from noise.

We strive for diversity and transparency of resources and welcome your [contributions](https://github.com/kagisearch/kite-public) to widen perspectives. This multi-source approach helps reveal the full picture beyond any single viewpoint.

Kite reads public RSS feeds of thousands of (community-curated) world-wide news sources and distills them into one perfect daily briefing. You get every critical perspective and timeline in just 5 minutes. That's it. No endless scrolling. No attention hijacking. Because we deserve better.

# Core principles

• One daily update (noon UTC), creating a natural endpoint to your news consumption
• Focus on facts and perspectives over opinions
• Zero compromise on privacy - your reading habits are yours alone
• Quality and depth over quantity
• Complete news diet in 5 minutes
• Liberation from the attention economy - exist in the moment, not in an endless scroll

# Customization

Personalize your feed by reordering and toggling categories in settings. Want to contribute? Most of Kite is [open source](https://github.com/kagisearch/kite-public), including our web app and community-curated feeds.
